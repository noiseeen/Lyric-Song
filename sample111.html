<h1 style="text-align:center"> When I Met You </h1>
<h5 style="text-align:center;"> covered by Justin Vasquez </h5>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Verse 1 </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">
There I was, an empty piece of a shell <br>
Just minding my own world without even knowing <br>
What love and life were all about <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
Then you came, you brought me out of the shell <br>
You gave the world to me, and before I knew <br>
There I was, so in love with you <br>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Chorus </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">
You gave me a reason for my being <br>
And I love what I'm feeling <br>
You gave me a meaning to my life <br>
And I've gone beyond existing <br>
And it all began when I met you <br>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Verse 2 </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">
I love the touch of your hair (your hair) <br>
And when I look in your eyes, I just know <br>
I know I'm on to something good <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
And I'm sure, my love for you will endure <br>
Your love will light up my world <br>
And take all my cares away with the aching part of me <br>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Chorus </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">
You gave me a reason for my being <br>
And I love what I'm feeling <br>
You gave me a meaning to my life <br>
And I've gone beyond existing <br>
And it all began when I met you <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
You gave me a meaning to my life <br>
And I've gone beyond existing <br>
And it all began, and it all began <br>
</p>
